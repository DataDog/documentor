# Style Guide for Documentation Site

This document is a guide to writing and editing documentation for the [Datadog Documentation site][7] (Docs site). Treat this as a guide rather than a rulebook. You should strive to follow what's prescribed, but there are exceptions to most rules.

Some of these guidelines are enforced by [the Datadog docs implementation of the Vale linter][4]. After you make a PR, check its **Files changed** tab to see and fix warnings and errors flagged by the linter.

## Language

- Use the American English **en_US** dialect when writing documentation, code comments, [wiki entries][1], and more in the English language. This is the default language for all `*.md` files.
- Don't contribute updates to the translated content (fr, ja, ko, es), as the content in GitHub is not the managed source. If there is a mistake in the English source file, fix the English source file. If the mistake is only in the translated version, let us know and we will get it addressed in the source.

## General principles

### Style and tone

The purpose of the Docs site is to clearly inform readers about how to use Datadog. The Docs site is NOT intended to:

- Sell or market Datadog
- Make the reader feel nice. When you must choose between politeness and clarity, choose clarity.
- Impress the reader with fancy words and drawn out sentences.

### Content

**Be plain and direct**: Say exactly what you mean using plain speech. Don't leave the reader guessing.
- **Recommended**: This integration does NOT help you forward application metrics from StatsD servers to Datadog; to do that, configure your StatsD server to forward metrics to DogStatsD.
- **Not recommended**: Please note the Datadog Agent includes DogStatsD, which serves as a StatsD forwarder. This integration is intended for monitoring external StatsD servers, and is not needed to send metrics to Datadog using the StatsD protocol.

**Be concise**: Omit needless words. Less is more:
- **Recommended**: This integration monitors the health and availability of a StatsD server.
- **Not recommended**: This integration offers you the ability to monitor the health and availability of a StatsD server.
- **Recommended**: The `ddtrace` library supports several web frameworks.
- **Not recommended**: The `ddtrace` library includes support for a number of web frameworks.

**Treat the reader as an equal**: Assume the reader is knowledgeable. Datadog has a technical audience, so don't spend too many words on something that's fairly common knowledge, for example, the meaning of `p95`. Likewise, don't assume the reader is clairvoyant—that's why they're reading docs. Avoid hedging statements and disclaimers, such as "As you probably know..."

**Provide examples**: Don't make an abstract statement and then leave the reader guessing.
- **Recommended**: "Often, two monitors grouped by different tags have reporting sources whose tag values never overlap, for example, `web04` and `web05` for a monitor grouped by host, or `dev` and `prod` for a monitor grouped by environment."
- **Not recommended**: "Often, two monitors grouped by different tags have reporting sources whose tag values never overlap."

**Be imperative, not beckoning**: When leading into a discussion of a feature, phrases like "you can" are ok, but when you finally get to the step-by-step instructions, command the reader:
- **Recommended**: Configure this thing. Optionally, configure that thing.
- **Not recommended**: You must configure this thing, and you may want to configure that thing.

**Don't wax philosophical**: Think pieces and pontification don't belong on the Docs site.

**Don't constantly explain basic Datadog features**: Outside of introductory material, don't tell readers again and again that metrics submitted to Datadog may be graphed alongside other metrics, have events overlaid onto them, etc. It's okay to point out cases that are compelling and specific, such as "Overlay Jenkins deploys onto a graph of your application response times", but don't re-explain Datadog; instead, provide a useful description that enhances understanding of the feature.

**Don't refer to multi-part integrations as a singular thing**: For multi-component integrations-especially those whose components are not interdependent-do not refer vaguely to "the integration".
- **Recommended**: [describe which component]: Installing the Datadog Agent BOSH release could increase the number of VMs...
- **OK**: Integrating with Cloud Foundry could increase the number of VMs...
- **Not recommended**: Installing the Cloud Foundry Integration could increase the number of VMs...

## Wording and grammar

### Abbreviations

Avoid using Latin abbreviations "i.e." or "e.g.". Use "that is" or "for example" instead.

### Active voice

Avoid using passive voice in favor of active voice. If you think your sentence is in the passive voice, add the phrase "by zombies". If it still makes grammatical sense, it's in the passive voice. For example, "metrics are sent to the Datadog Agent `by zombies`"
- **Recommended**: "With infrastructure monitoring, the Datadog Agent receives metrics and forwards them to Datadog. Similarly, the Datadog Agent can also receive tracing metrics."
- **Not recommended**: "With Datadog infrastructure monitoring, metrics are sent to the Datadog Agent, which then forwards them to Datadog. Similarly, tracing metrics are also sent to the Datadog Agent."

### Inclusive language

Use inclusive language unless you are referencing third-party technologies such as Redis' master/slave nodes. The Datadog docs follow the inclusive language best practices described in the [Terminology, Power and Inclusive Language](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-knodel-terminology) document from the Center for Democracy & Technology.
- **Recommended**: "Primary/secondary, disallowlist/allowlist"
- **Not recommended**: "Master/slave, blacklist/whitelist"

### Pronouns

#### Gender

Use gender-neutral pronouns as appropriate. Avoid using "he", "him", "his", "she", and "her". Also avoid using combination pronouns such as "he/she" or "(s)he" or similar. Use "they" or "them" instead.

#### First and second person pronouns

Avoid first-person pronouns such as "I", "me", "mine", "we", "us", and "our". Use second-person pronouns "you" and "your" (often implied).
- **Recommended**: Datadog APM is included in Enterprise plans or as an upgrade from Pro plans. If you have a Pro plan, visit the APM page in Datadog to begin a free 14-day trial.
- **Not recommended**: Datadog APM is included in our Enterprise plan or as an upgrade to our Pro plan. Pro plan members can visit the APM page in Datadog to begin a free 14-day trial.

Adding "You can" to the start of an instruction changes it to a suggestion. Be intentional about your use of each kind of sentence:
- **Instruction**: Change the environment variable value in your `datadog.yaml` file.
- **Suggestion**: You can change the environment variable value in your `datadog.yaml` file.

Don't overuse "your" when talking about the items a person interacts with when using Datadog. "Your infrastructure" is okay in moderation. Too much "your Agent" or "your application" is overly familiar. Try "the" instead and see if it works just as well.

### Tense

Avoid temporal words like "currently", "now", "will", etc. Describe the present state of the product.
- **Recommended**: "Once you enable the integration, the Agent starts sending metrics to Datadog."
- **Not recommended**: "Once you enable the integration, the Agent will start sending metrics to Datadog."
- **Recommended**: You can add up to 10 monitors in a composite monitor.
- **Not recommended**: Currently, you can add up to 10 monitors in a composite monitor (more will be supported in the future).
- **Recommended**: You can add up to 20 monitors in a composite monitor.
- **Not recommended**: You can now add up to 20 monitors in a composite monitor.

**Note**: When Datadog implements or deprecates a major feature, it's good to point it out, for example: "The `docker` check replaces the `docker_daemon` check beginning with Agent version X.Y.Z.".

### Words and phrases

The [datadog-vale][4] repo contains a set of linting rules for Vale based on the Documentation Style Guide. You can refer to the rules when writing for the Docs site.

Otherwise, here are some words and phrases to avoid or use sparingly:

| Word to avoid        | Workaround                                                                                 |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Refer to/visit       | When preceding a link; use "See" or "Read"                                                 |
| A number of          | This is vague. Slightly less vague: "a few", "several", "many".                            |
| [in the] Datadog app | No need for the definite article; use "[in] Datadog".                                      |
| Product              | When referencing Datadog (e.g. "the Datadog product"), omit it or use "service"            |
| Please               | There's no reason to plead with the reader; maybe they'll read the docs, maybe they won't. |
| Utilize              | Don't utilize utilize when you can use use.                                                |

#### RFC 2119

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the documentation are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119][2]. When writing in languages other than English, a best-effort must be made to adhere to this RFC.

#### RFC 2606

A top level domain (TLD) in an example must reference a TLD permanently reserved for such purposes. As described in [RFC 2606][3] four TLD names are reserved:
- `.test`
- `.example`
- `.invalid`
- `.localhost`

Same goes for second level domain names, three are reserved:
- `example.com`
- `example.net`
- `example.org`

## Punctuation

This section sets the record straight (for the Docs site, not for all humankind) on grammar and punctuation details that are often a matter of subjective preference.

### Commas

Use the Oxford/Harvard/serial comma:
- **Recommended**: "Metrics, events, and service checks."
- **Not recommended**: "Metrics, events and service checks".

### Dashes

Use the em dash (—) with no spaces between adjacent words
- **Recommended**: "The rest—Ok, Skipped, and No Data—are not alert-worthy."
- **Not recommended**: "The rest - Ok, Skipped, and No Data - are not alert-worthy".

### Spaces

Only one space between sentences (not two).

## Formatting

### Code substitution

When adding something to a code block that isn't meant literally, use the format `<DATADOG_API_KEY>`. _Don't_ use `$DATADOG_API_KEY`, `{DATADOG API KEY}`, or `DATADOG_API_KEY`.

### Headers

| Level                    | Case          |
|--------------------------|---------------|
| `<h1>` / `# Header`      | Title Case    |
| `<h2>` / `## Header`     | Sentence case |
| `<h3>` / `### Header`    | Sentence case |
| `<h4>` / `#### Header`   | Sentence case |
| `<h5>` / `##### Header`  | Sentence case |
| `<h6>` / `###### Header` | Sentence case |

### Images

Images are displayed on the full width of a page by default. If your image doesn't need to be that large, use the `style="width:XX%;"` parameter within the image partial to scale the image proportionally.

See the documentation wiki to learn more about [image partials][6].

### Links

Format links using numbered [reference-style links][8], and use relative paths for other pages published on the documentation site. For example, instead of embedding the URL directly in the text, write `read the [Getting Started with Azure][1]` and define the link reference at the bottom of the file like `[1]: /getting_started/azure/`.

Avoid vague link text, let readers know where you're sending them. Any sentence containing a link should read just as well if it didn't have the link.
- **Recommended**: To learn more about tagging, see the `[Guide to Tagging]`.
- **Not recommended**: To learn more about tagging, see `[here]`.

### Numbers

Use words for single digit numbers (zero through nine). Use numbers for multiple digit numbers (10 and above), decimals (0.9, 1.5, 10.3, etc.), and percents (1%, 1.5%, 10%, etc.). Do not use commas in four figure numbers, for example, `5000`.

### Text

Use text formatting to clarify and enhance content.

| Formatting        | Rule                                                                                                           | Example                                               |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `` `backquote` `` | Used for code related content within a sentence.                                                               | Use the `foo` parameter                               |
| `**Bold**`        | Subjectively pointing the reader to something important.                                                       | **This is important**, not that.                      |
| `_Italic_`        | Literally translated words, default values, functions, settings, and page names.                               | Go to the *setting* page in your Datadog application |
| `[Link][3]`       | Links must be specified using the reference format (in the footnote) to aid with the [translation process][5]. | Text with `[a link][1]`                               |

title: Application Security Management
description: Monitor threats targeting production system, leveraging the execution context provided by distributed traces.
---

{{< img src="/security/application_security/app-sec-landing-page.png" alt="A security signal panel in Datadog, which displays attack flows and flame graphs" width="75%">}}

Datadog Application Security Management (ASM) provides protection against application-level attacks that aim to exploit code-level vulnerabilities, such as Server-Side-Request-Forgery (SSRF), SQL injection, Log4Shell, and Reflected Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS). You can monitor and protect apps hosted directly on a server, Docker, Kubernetes, Amazon ECS, and (for supported languages) AWS Fargate.

ASM leverages Datadog [tracing libraries][1], and the [Datadog Agent][2] to identify services exposed to application attacks. Once configured, ASM leverages in-app detection rules to detect and protect against threats in your application environment and trigger security signals whenever an attack impacts your production system, or a vulnerability is triggered from the code.

When a threat is detected, a security signal is generated in Datadog. For `HIGH` or `CRITICAL` severity security signals, notifications can be sent to Slack, email, or PagerDuty to notify your team and provide real-time context around threats.

Once a security signal is triggered, quickly pivot to investigate and protect in Datadog. Leverage the deep observability data provided by ASM and APM distributed tracing, in one view, to resolve application issues. Analyze attack flows, view flame graphs, and review correlated trace and log data to pinpoint application vulnerabilities. Eliminate context switching by flowing through application data into remediation and mitigation steps, all within the same panel.

With ASM, you can cut through the noise of continuous trace data to focus on securing and protecting your environment.

Until you fully remediate the potential vulnerabilities in your application code, ASM enables you to slow down attackers by blocking their IPs temporarily or permanently, with a single click.

## Understanding how application security is implemented in Datadog

If you're curious how Application Security Management is structured and how it uses tracing data to identify security problems, read [How Application Security Management Works][3].

## Configure your environment

Powered by provided [out-of-the-box rules][4], ASM detects threats without manual configuration. If you already have Datadog [APM][1] configured on a physical or virtual host, setup only requires setting one environment variable to get started.

To start configuring your environment to detect and protect threats with ASM, follow the [Enabling documentation][5]. Once ASM is configured, you can begin investigating and remediating security signals in the [Security Signals Explorer][6].

## Investigate and remediate security signals

In the [Security Signals Explorer][6], click on any security signal to see what happened and the suggested steps to mitigate the attack. In the same panel, view traces with their correlated attack flow and request information to gain further context.

## Investigate risk introduced in upstream open source libraries and dependencies

[Software Composition Analysis (SCA)][8] shows you when your services are at risk because they use or have dependencies on open source libraries that have known vulnerabilities. Investigate vulnerability findings and secure your software by following remediation advice or researching the cause of the vulnerability.

title: How Application Security Management Works in Datadog
---

## Overview

Datadog Application Security Management (ASM) provides observability into application-level attacks that aim to exploit code-level vulnerabilities or abuse the business logic of your application, and into any bad actors targeting your systems.

In addition, ASM detects the risks built into your applications, for example through vulnerable libraries and dependencies the application uses at runtime.

Datadog APM records information, called traces, about each application request. Datadog ASM uses the same tracing libraries as APM to monitor your traffic. ASM flags attack attempts based on security traces that match known attack patterns, or [tags business logic information][25]. Security signals are automatically created when Datadog detects application attacks or business logic abuse impacting your services. The signals identify meaningful threats for your review instead of assessing each individual attack attempt. Depending on your security signal settings, you can receive notifications from Slack, email, or PagerDuty.

Traditional Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) are usually deployed at the perimeter and have no context of the application behavior. Because ASM is embedded in the application, it has access to trace data, making it more effective at pinpointing and classifying threats. Datadog ASM leverages known attack patterns, similar to a Web Application Firewall (WAF) but with additional application context to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, lowering false positives.

### Identify services exposed to application attacks

Datadog ASM [Threat Management][1] uses the information APM is already collecting, and flags traces containing attack attempts. Services exposed to application attacks are highlighted directly in the security views embedded in APM ([Service Catalog][2], [Service Page][3], [Traces][4]).

Because APM collects a sample of your application traffic, enabling ASM in the tracing library is necessary to effectively monitor and protect your services.

Datadog Threat Monitoring and Detection identifies bad actors by collecting client IP addresses and manually-added user tags on all requests.

<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>1-Click Enablement</strong><br>
If your service is running with <a href="/agent/remote_config/#enabling-remote-configuration">an Agent with Remote Configuration enabled and a tracing library version that supports it</a>, you can <a href="/security/application_security/enabling/">enable ASM</a> from the Datadog UI without additional configuration of the Agent or tracing libraries.</div>

### Identify vulnerable services

Datadog [Software Composition Analysis][5] uses various known vulnerability data sources related to open source software libraries, plus information provided by the Datadog security research team, to match the libraries your application depends on at runtime with their potential vulnerabilities, and to make remediation recommendations.

## Compatibility

For Datadog ASM to be compatible with your Datadog configuration, you must have APM enabled, and [send traces to Datadog][6]. ASM uses the same libraries used by APM, so you don't need to deploy and maintain another library. Steps to enable Datadog ASM are specific to runtime language. Check to see if your language is supported in the [ASM prerequisites][7].

### Serverless monitoring

Datadog ASM for AWS Lambda provides deep visibility into attackers targeting your functions. With distributed tracing providing a context-rich picture of the attack, you can assess the impact and remediate the threat effectively.

Read [Enabling ASM for Serverless][8] for information on setting it up.

## Performance

Datadog ASM uses processes already contained in the Agent and APM, so there are negligible performance implications when using it. When APM is enabled, the Datadog library generates distributed traces. Datadog ASM flags security activity in traces by using known attack patterns. Correlation between the attack patterns and the execution context provided by the distributed trace triggers security signals based on detection rules.

{{< img src="security/application_security/How_Appsec_Works_June2023.png" alt="A diagram illustrates that the Datadog tracer library operates at the application service level and sends traces to the Datadog backend. The Datadog backend flags actionable security signals and sends a notification to the relevant application, such as PagerDuty, Jira or Slack." >}}

## Data sampling and retention

In the tracing library, Datadog ASM collects all traces that include security data. A default [retention filter][9] ensures the retention of all security-related traces in the Datadog platform.

Data for security traces is kept for 90 days. The underlying trace data is kept for 15 days.

## Data privacy

By default, ASM collects information from security traces to help you understand why the request was flagged as suspicious. Before sending the data, ASM scans it for patterns and keywords that indicate that the data is sensitive. If the data is deemed sensitive, it is replaced with a `<redacted>` flag. This indicates that the request was suspicious, but that the request data could not be collected because of data security concerns.

Here are some examples of data that is flagged as sensitive by default:
* `pwd`, `password`, `ipassword`, `pass_phrase`
* `secret`
* `key`, `api_key`, `private_key`, `public_key`
* `token`
* `consumer_id`, `consumer_key`, `consumer_secret`
* `sign`, `signed`, `signature`
* `bearer`
* `authorization`
* `BEGIN PRIVATE KEY`
* `ssh-rsa`

To configure the information redacted by ASM, refer to the [data security configuration][17]

## Threat detection methods

Datadog uses multiple pattern sources, including the [OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set][12] to detect known threats and vulnerabilities in HTTP requests. When an HTTP request matches one of [the OOTB detection rules][13], a security signal is generated in Datadog.

**Automatic Threat Patterns Updates:** If your service is running with [an Agent with Remote Configuration enabled and a tracing library version that supports it][26] , the threat patterns being used to monitor your service are automatically updated whenever Datadog publishes updates.

Security Signals are automatically created when Datadog detects meaningful attacks targeting your production services. It provides you with visibility on the attackers and the targeted services. You can set custom detection rules with thresholds to determine which attacks you want to be notified about.

## Attack attempt qualification

Leveraging distributed tracing information, attacks attempts are qualified as safe, unknown, or harmful.
* Attack attempts qualified as safe cannot breach your application, for example, when a PHP injection attack targets a service written in Java.
* An unknown qualification is decided when there is not enough information to make a definitive judgement about the attack's probability of success.
* A harmful qualification is highlighted when there is evidence that a code level vulnerability has been found by the attacker.

## Threat monitoring coverage

Datadog ASM includes over 100 attack signatures that help protect against [many different kinds of attacks][14], including, but not limited to, the following categories:

* SQL injections
* Code injections
* Shell injections
* NoSQL injections
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF)

## Built-in vulnerability detection

Datadog ASM offers built-in detection capabilities that warn you about the vulnerabilities detected in your open source dependencies. Details of that information are shown in the [Vulnerability Explorer][15], identifying the severity, affected services, potentially vulnerable infrastructure, and remediation instructions to solve the surfaced risks.

For more information, read [Software Composition Analysis][5].

## API security

<div class="alert alert-info">API security is in private beta.</div>

Datadog Application Security Management (ASM) provides visibility into threats targeting your APIs. Use the [API Catalog][27] to monitor API health and performance metrics, where you can view attacks targeting your APIs. This view includes the attacker's IP and authentication information, as well as request headers showing details about how the attack was formed. Using both ASM and API management, you can maintain a comprehensive view of your API attack surface, and respond to mitigate threats.

## How Datadog ASM protects against Log4Shell

Datadog ASM identifies Log4j Log4Shell attack payloads and provides visibility into vulnerable apps that attempt to remotely load malicious code. When used in tandem with the rest of [Datadog's Cloud SIEM][16], you can investigate to identify common post-exploitation activity, and proactively remediate potentially vulnerable Java web services acting as an attack vector.
